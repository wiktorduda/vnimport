FAQ
=====

Why the plugin interface looks so bad?
----

* There are no styling options and only limited dialog from Playnite_'s API. It is possible to have better interface if they update their API, but for the moment, it is the best I can provide.

Where do I get those metadata?
-----

* Those data are from API of erogetrailers_. The API provide product ID of Getchu.com_. Therefore, I can use the product ID to download cover image from Getchu.com_
